### Presentations
1. Show your Passion and Connect with your Audience

    *Be enthusiastic and honest, and the audience will respond.*

2. Focus on your Audienceâ€™s Needs

    *You need to make it easy for your audience to understand and respond.*

3. Keep it Simple: Concentrate on your Core Message

    *What is the key message (or three key points) for my audience to take away?*

4. Smile and Make Eye Contact with your Audience

    *If you smile and make eye contact, you are building rapport, which helps the audience to connect with you and your subject. It also helps you to feel less nervous, because you are talking to individuals, not to a great mass of unknown people.*

5. Start Strongly

    *Try a story (see tip 7 below), or an attention-grabbing (but useful) image on a slide.*

6. Tell Stories

    *Human beings are programmed to respond to stories.*

7. Use your Voice and Body to c=Communicate

    *Make your gestures open and confident, and move naturally around the stage, and among the audience too, if possible.*

8. Relax, Breathe and Enjoy

    *If you can bring yourself to relax, you will almost certainly present better. If you can actually start to enjoy yourself, your audience will respond to that, and engage better.*
