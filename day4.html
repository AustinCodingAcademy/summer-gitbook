<h3 id="marketing-plan">Marketing Plan</h3>
<p>A marketing plan is a plan to market your company. Marketing means creating relationships with and satisfying customers. </p>
<p>A marketing plan contains one or more marketing strategies. It is the framework from which all of your marketing strategies are created, and helps you connect each strategy back to a larger marketing operation and business goal.</p>
<h4 id="how-to-write-a-marketing-plan">How to Write a Marketing Plan</h4>
<ol>
<li>Business Mission - what are you trying to accomplish?</li>
<li>Determine the Key Performance Indicators (KPI&apos;s) for this mission - what does success look like?</li>
<li>Identify the buyer - who is buying your products or services?</li>
<li>Describe your content initiatives and strategies - how are you going to get them to buy your product or service?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Business Mission - what are you trying to accomplish?</li>
</ul>
<p>Your first step in writing a marketing plan is to state your mission. Although this mission is specific to your marketing department, it should serve your business&apos;s main mission statement. Be specific, but not too specific. You have plenty of space left in this marketing plan to elaborate on how you&apos;ll acquire new customers and accomplish this mission.</p>
<p>For example, if your business&apos;s mission is &quot;to make booking travel a delightful experience,&quot; your marketing mission might be &quot;to attract an audience of travelers, educate them on the tourism industry, and convert them into users of our bookings platform.&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>Determine the Key Performance Indicators (KPI&apos;s) for this mission - what does success look like?</li>
</ul>
<p>Every good marketing plan describes how the department will track its mission&apos;s progress. To do so, you&apos;ll need to determine your key performance indicators, or &quot;KPIs&quot; for short. KPIs are individual metrics that measure the various elements of a marketing campaign. These units help you establish short-term goals within your mission and communicate your progress to business leaders.</p>
<p>Let&apos;s take our example marketing mission from the above step. If part of our mission is &quot;to attract an audience of travelers,&quot; we might track websites visits using organic page views. In this case, &quot;organic page views&quot; is one KPI, and we can see our number of page views grow over time.</p>
<p>These KPIs will come into the conversation again in step 4, below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify the buyer - who is buying your products or services?</li>
</ul>
<p>A buyer persona is a description of whom you want to attract. This can include age, sex, location, family size, job title, and more. Each buyer persona should be a direct reflection of your business&apos;s customers and potential customers. Therefore, it&apos;s critical that business leaders all agree on what your buyer personas are.</p>
<p>You can develop buyer personas for free right here.</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe your content initiatives and strategies - how are you going to get them to buy your product or service?</li>
</ul>
<p>Here&apos;s where you&apos;ll include the main points of your marketing and content strategy. Because there are a laundry list of content types and channels available to you today, it&apos;s critical that you choose wisely and explain how you&apos;ll use your content and channels in this section of your marketing plan.</p>
<!-- A content strategy should stipulate:

Which types of content you'll create. These can include blog posts, YouTube videos, infographics, ebooks, and more.
How much of it you'll create. You can describe content volume in daily, weekly, monthly, or even quarterly intervals. It all depends on your workflow and the short-term goals you set for your content.
The goals (and KPIs) you'll use to track each type. KPIs can include organic traffic, social media traffic, email traffic, and referral traffic. Your goals should also include which pages you want to drive that traffic to, such as product pages, blog pages, or landing pages.
The channels on which you'll distribute this content. Some popular channels at your disposal include Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, Pinterest, and Instagram. 
Any paid advertising that will take place on these channels.-->
<!-- 1. Clearly define your plan's omissions.  

A marketing plan explains what the marketing team is going to focus on. However, it also explains what the marketing team is not going to focus on.

If there are other aspects of your business that you aren't serving in this particular plan, include them in this section. These omissions help to justify your mission, buyer personas, KPIs, and content. You can't please everyone in a single marketing campaign, and if your team isn't on the hook for something, you need to make it known. -->
<!-- 1. Define your marketing budget.

Your content strategy might leverage many free channels and platforms, but there are a number of hidden expenses to a marketing team that need to be accounted for.

Whether it's freelance fees, sponsorships, or a new full-time marketing hire, use these costs to develop a marketing budget and outline each expense in this section of your marketing plan.

1. Identify your competition.

Part of marketing is knowing whom you're marketing against. Research the key players in your industry and consider profiling each one in this section.

Keep in mind not every competitor will pose the same challenges to your business. For example, while one competitor might be ranking highly on search engines for keywords you want your website to rank for, another competitor might have a heavy footprint on a social network where you plan to launch an account.

1. Outline your plan's contributors and their responsibilities.

With your marketing plan fully fleshed out, it's time to explain who's doing what. You don't have to delve too deeply into your employees' day-to-day projects, but it should be known which teams and team leaders are in charge of specific content types, channels, KPIs, and more. -->
